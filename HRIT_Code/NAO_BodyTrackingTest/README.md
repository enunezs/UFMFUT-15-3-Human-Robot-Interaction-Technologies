# single-person-live-movement-detection

This uses opencv and medapipe to detect a person's joints and see if they move in real time using a webcam.
This project is a WIP as I would like it to detect multiple people.

This is currently used on a NAO robot to play "Red Light Green Light" with a single player.

Please make note as each script needs to work at the same time and both require an infinate loop.
